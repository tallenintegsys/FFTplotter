I forked this from Autopatch. I was trying to work in some plots of the FFT results--really in an attempt to debug or at least better understand what was happening--but getting the plots to work took a lot of time and there isn't really enough screen real-estate or horse power to do this on the device. So I'm going to just write a CSV file from FFTplotter and keep this to get it working as a AF spectrum analyzer. There are probably plenty of spectrum analyzers out there but I want to play with the Android plot library more anyway. Bottom line, this is a toy that you probably won't find very interesting and you can probably get something better from the app store, but we'll see where it goes.
