status: usable, I'll probably add this to the app store soon

I forked this from AutoPatch. I was trying to work in some plots of the FFT results--really in an attempt to debug or at least better understand what was happening--but getting the plots to work took a lot of time and there isn't really enough screen real-estate or horse power to do this on the device. 

There are probably plenty of spectrum analyzers out there but I want to play with the Android plot library more anyway. Bottom line, this is a toy that you probably won't find very interesting and you can probably get something better from the app store, but we'll see where it goes.

For now this does the FFT in Java, perhapse I will port FFTw to Android as an JNI / NDK, I have to learn gradle-experimental / clion anyway.
